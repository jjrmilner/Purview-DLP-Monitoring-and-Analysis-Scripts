## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures:**
```powershell
# Verify Microsoft Graph permissions
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.Read.All", "AuditLog.Read.All"

# Test Exchange Online connection
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@domain.com
```

**Performance Monitoring Issues:**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator for process access
# Check if DLP services are running
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*Sense*" -or $_.Name -like "*Defender*"}
```

**OneDrive Path Issues:**
```powershell
# Scripts automatically handle long paths with junctions
# Manual junction creation if needed:
mklink /J C:\TEMP_DLP "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Long\Path"
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Environments:**
- Use `-PerformanceMode` for faster policy analysis
- Reduce monitoring duration for quick assessments
- Use `-QuickTest` for rapid health checks
- Schedule monitoring during off-peak hours

**For Detailed Analysis:**
- Increase monitoring duration to 15-30 minutes
- Enable all export options for trend analysis
- Use full monitoring mode for comprehensive assessment
- Run individual components for focused analysis

## üìù Advanced Configuration

### Custom KPI Thresholds
Modify KPI thresholds in each script's configuration section:
```powershell
$EventLogKPIs = @{
    ErrorRate = 2.0                    # < 2% of DLP operations
    WarningThreshold = 10.0            # < 10% warning events per day
    PolicySyncFailures = 2.0           # < 2% policy sync failures
    AgentHealthThreshold = 95.0        # > 95% agent availability
}
```

### Scheduling with Task Scheduler
Create automated monitoring with Windows Task Scheduler:
```powershell
# Example scheduled task for daily monitoring
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" -Argument "-File C:\DLP-Monitoring\Master-DLPMonitoring.ps1 -MonitoringMode Essential -ExportReports"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "06:00"
$Settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -ExecutionTimeLimit (New-TimeSpan -Hours 2)
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "DLP-Daily-Monitoring" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Settings -User "DOMAIN\ServiceAccount" -Password "Password"
```

### Integration with Monitoring Systems
Export CSV data can be integrated with:
- **SIEM Systems**: Import CSV data for alerting and dashboards
- **Power BI**: Create executive dashboards from exported data
- **Azure Monitor**: Send metrics to Azure for cloud-based monitoring
- **System Center**: Integration with SCOM for enterprise monitoring

### FAQ: MSP and Consulting Use

**Q: Can an MSP or consultant use this tool in a paid engagement?**  
**A:** It depends on how the tool is used:  
- **Allowed:** If the tool is used internally by the end customer (e.g., installed in their tenant) and the consultant is simply assisting, this is generally acceptable.  
- **Not allowed without a commercial licence:** If the MSP or consultant provides a managed service where the tool runs in their own environment (e.g., their tenant or infrastructure) or if the value of the service substantially derives from the tool‚Äôs functionality, this falls under the definition of ‚ÄúSell‚Äù in the Commons Clause and requires a commercial licence.

**Q: Why is this restricted?**  
The Commons Clause removes the right to ‚ÄúSell,‚Äù which includes providing a service for a fee where the value derives from the software. This ensures fair use and prevents competitors from monetising the tool without contributing back.

**Q: How do I get a commercial licence?**
