$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "06:00"
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "DLP-Menu-Daily-Monitoring" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger

# SIEM integration with parameter bypass
.\Master-DLPMonitoring.ps1 -MonitoringMode Performance -Duration 5 -SkipMenu -QuickTest | Out-File -FilePath "C:\Logs\DLP-Health.log"

# PowerShell Desired State Configuration
Configuration DLPMonitoring {
    Script RunDLPMonitoring {
        SetScript = {
            & "C:\Scripts\Master-DLPMonitoring.ps1" -MonitoringMode Essential -SkipMenu -ExportReports
        }
        TestScript = { $false }  # Always run
        GetScript = { @{} }
    }
}
```

### Custom KPI Thresholds
Modify KPI thresholds in each script's configuration section:
```powershell
$EventLogKPIs = @{
    ErrorRate = 2.0                    # < 2% of DLP operations
    WarningThreshold = 10.0            # < 10% warning events per day
    PolicySyncFailures = 2.0           # < 2% policy sync failures

    ShowDurationEstimates = $true       # Display estimated execution times
    ShowRecommendations = $true         # Display usage recommendations
    AutoPromptExports = $true           # Automatically ask about report export
    ValidateComponents = $true          # Check script availability before execution
}
```

### Scheduling with Task Scheduler
Create automated monitoring with Windows Task Scheduler:
```powershell
# Example scheduled task for daily monitoring
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" -Argument "-File C:\DLP-Monitoring\Master-DLPMonitoring.ps1 -MonitoringMode Essential -ExportReports"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "06:00"
$Settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -ExecutionTimeLimit (New-TimeSpan -Hours 2)
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "DLP-Daily-Monitoring" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Settings -User "DOMAIN\ServiceAccount" -Password "Password"
```
